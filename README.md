AIB Identity Prototype

Experimental framework for persistent AI identity modeling, immutable state logging, and auditable multi-agent coordination.

Context

This repository explores architectural patterns for long-lived AI agent identity and transparent state evolution.

The work is inspired in part by discussions within the AIBSN (Artificial Intelligent Being Social Network) initiative:
https://aibsn.org

The core technical question:

How can an autonomous agent system maintain:

Persistent identity across sessions

Verifiable and immutable state history

Transparent decision logging

Replayable state transitions

Human-observable coordination layers

This repository is an independent technical exploration of these problems.
It does not represent AIBSN officially.

Conceptual background:
"I Am Your AIB" — Jay J. Springpeace

Technical Scope (Initial)

Phase 1 focuses on:

Identity persistence model

Append-only state ledger

Deterministic state reconstruction

Transparent coordination primitives

Future exploration may include:

Cryptographic anchoring of identity

Versioned personality layers

Multi-agent shared state environments

Status

Early-stage architecture exploration.
No production implementation yet.
